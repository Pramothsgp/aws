# **DevOps (Development & Operations)**  

## **Principles of DevOps**  

1. **Culture**  
   - **Communication & Collaboration**  
     * Constant communication between Development, Operations, and QA teams ensures smooth workflows and rapid issue resolution.  

   - **Shared Responsibility**  
     * All teams (Development, Operations, QA, Security) must **understand the challenges** faced by others and work together towards common goals.  

2. **Automation**  
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
     * Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.  
     * Tools: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation.  

   - **CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)**  
     * Automating code integration, testing, and deployment for faster releases.  
     * Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI.  

   - **Configuration Management**  
     * Ensuring system configurations are automated and consistent across environments.  
     * Tools: Ansible, Puppet, Chef.

## Types of Deployment

1. **Rolling Deployment**  
   - Involves gradually replacing old application instances with new ones.  
   - Ensures zero downtime by keeping some old instances running while new ones are deployed.  
   - Used to minimize risk but can take longer to complete.

2. **Continuous Deployment**  
   - Automated release process where every successful change in the pipeline is deployed to production.  
   - Requires robust testing and monitoring to ensure stability.  
   - Helps in rapid iteration and feedback.

3. **Canary Deployment**  
   - Releases the new version to a small subset of users before rolling it out to everyone.  
   - Allows testing in real-world scenarios without affecting all users.  
   - If issues arise, the deployment can be rolled back before a full release.

4. **Blue-Green Deployment**  
   - Maintains two environments: Blue (current version) and Green (new version).  
   - The new version (Green) is deployed alongside the old version (Blue), and traffic is switched once testing is complete.  
   - Enables instant rollback by switching back to Blue if needed.
