# **DevOps (Development & Operations)**  

## **Principles of DevOps**  

1. **Culture**  
   - **Communication & Collaboration**  
     * Constant communication between Development, Operations, and QA teams ensures smooth workflows and rapid issue resolution.  

   - **Shared Responsibility**  
     * All teams (Development, Operations, QA, Security) must **understand the challenges** faced by others and work together towards common goals.  

2. **Automation**  
   - **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
     * Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.  
     * Tools: Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation.  

   - **CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment)**  
     * Automating code integration, testing, and deployment for faster releases.  
     * Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI.  

   - **Configuration Management**  
     * Ensuring system configurations are automated and consistent across environments.  
     * Tools: Ansible, Puppet, Chef.
