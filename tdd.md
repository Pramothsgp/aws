### **Your Notes on TDD Look Good!**  
Hereâ€™s a small improvement for clarity and structure:

---

## **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
**Definition:** Writing test cases before writing the actual code to ensure the code meets the requirements from the start.

### **Phases of Testing**
1. **Sanity Testing**  
   - Ensures that the basic requirements are met.
   - Quick checks to verify the application is stable for further testing.

2. **Functional Testing**  
   - Tests the complete functionality of the application.
   - Ensures each feature works as expected.

3. **Regression Testing**  
   - Tests old and new functionalities together.
   - Ensures new changes do not break existing features.

4. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**  
   - The final phase of testing, also known as **Beta Testing**.
   - Performed by end users to validate the application before release.

### **Phases of TDD**
1. **Red**  
   - Write a failing test case based on the requirement.
   - The test will fail because the functionality is not yet implemented.

2. **Green**  
   - Write the minimum amount of code required to make the test pass.
   - Focus on making the test succeed with the simplest possible solution.

3. **Refactor**  
   - Optimize and clean up the code while ensuring all tests still pass.
   - Improve performance, remove redundancies, and enhance maintainability.
